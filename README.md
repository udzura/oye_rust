# OyeRust

This is a sample (:?gem|crate) for demonstrating cargo support in rubygems.

See slide: <TBA>

## Installation

Above all, you must set up your Rust and cargo environment (and also some Rubies) where you run.

Then install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add oye_rust

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install oye_rust

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
